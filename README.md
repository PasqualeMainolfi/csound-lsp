# Csound Language Server (Work in Progress)

This is an experimental Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation for Csound, written in Rust.  
The goal of this project is to provide a modern development experience for Csound users by integrating language features directly into editors such as  Zed, VS Code, Neovim, and others that support LSP.

**Current Status**
This project is under active development.  
Many features are incomplete or experimental, and breaking changes are expected.
